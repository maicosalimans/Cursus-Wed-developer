<p>"Babe"</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Babe, I'm leaving, I must be on my way</p>
<p>The time is drawing near</p>
<p>My train is going, I see it in your eyes</p>
<p>The love, the need, your tears</p>
<p>But I'll be lonely without you</p>
<p>And I'll need your love to see me through</p>
<p>Please believe me, my heart is in your hands</p>
<p>And I'll be missing you</p>
<p> </p>
<p>You know it's you Babe</p>
<p>Whenever I get weary and I've had enough</p>
<p>Feel like giving up</p>
<p>You know it's you Babe</p>
<p>Giving me the courage and the strength I need</p>
<p>Please believe that it's true</p>
<p>Babe, I love you</p>
<p></p>
<p>You know it's you Babe</p>
<p>Whenever I get weary and I've had enough</p>
<p>Feel like giving up</p>
<p>You know it's you Babe</p>
<p>Giving me the courage and the strength I need</p>
<p>Please believe that it's true</p>
<p>Babe, I love you</p>
<p></p>
<p>Babe, I'm leaving, I'll say it once again</p>
<p>Somehow try to smile</p>
<p>I know the feeling we're trying to forget</p>
<p>If only for a while</p>
<p>Cause I'll be lonely without you</p>
<p>And I'll need your love to see me through</p>
<p>Please believe me, my heart is in your hands</p>
<p>Cause I'll be missing you</p>
<p>Babe, I love you</p>
<p>Babe, I love you</p>
<p>Oh, Babe</p>
