Babe, I'm leaving, I must be on my way<br>
The time is drawing near<br>
My train is going, I see it in your eyes<br>
The love, the need, your tears<br>
But I'll be lonely without you<br>
And I'll need your love to see me through<br>
Please believe me, my heart is in your hands<br>
And I'll be missing you<br>
<br> 
You know it's you Babe<br>
Whenever I get weary and I've had enough<br>
Feel like giving up<br>
You know it's you Babe<br>
Giving me the courage and the strength I need<br>
Please believe that it's true<br>
Babe, I love you<br>
<br>
You know it's you Babe<br>
Whenever I get weary and I've had enough<br>
Feel like giving up<br>
You know it's you Babe<br>
Giving me the courage and the strength I need<br>
Please believe that it's true<br>
Babe, I love you<br>
<br>
Babe, I'm leaving, I'll say it once again<br>
Somehow try to smile<br>
I know the feeling we're trying to forget<br>
If only for a while<br>
Cause I'll be lonely without you<br>
And I'll need your love to see me through<br>
Please believe me, my heart is in your hands<br>
Cause I'll be missing you<br>
Babe, I love you<br>
Babe, I love you<br>
Oh, Babe<br>
<br>
